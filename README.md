## [Description](#table-of-contents)
What's For Dinner is a Full-Stack 7-Meal Planner and a helpful addition to any user's meal-prep arsenal. Be it someone that works long hours and is too tired to think of new meal ideas constantly or an indecisive food-lover that wants to try new recipes, 7 Meal Planner helps alleviate the stress of searching for new meals by randomly generating meal ideas for you! It uses the recipe-scraper npm package to scour supported websites and pull all the useful information you need into one place for easy reference and to save userâ€™s from scanning through the sometimes endless scrolling of recipe blogs. In addition to users having a secure profile to access and add, update or delete a meal plan, through clicking on a chosen meal in their plan, users are able to visit a recipe card with a comment section where they can post feedback, likes or dislikes to share with other users.
